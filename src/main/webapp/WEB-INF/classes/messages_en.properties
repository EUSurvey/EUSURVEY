message.about.paragraph.one=	<p>EUSurvey is an online survey management system for creating and publishing forms available to the public, e.g. user satisfaction surveys and public consultations.</p>\
								<p>Launched in 2013, EUSurvey is the European Commission's official survey management tool. Its main purpose is to create official surveys of public opinion and forms for internal communication and staff management, e.g. staff opinion surveys and forms for evaluation or registration.</p>\
								<p>EUSurvey provides a wide variety of elements used in forms, ranging from the simple (e.g. text questions and multiple-choice questions) to the advanced (e.g. editable spreadsheets and multimedia elements).</p>\
								<p>The application, hosted at the European Commission's Department for digital services (DG DIGIT), is available free of charge to all EU citizens. EUSurvey can be accessed from:</p>
message.about.paragraph.two=	<p>Built at DG DIGIT and funded under the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/home_en" target="_blank">ISA² programme</a>, EUSurvey is fully open-source and is published under the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/home" target="_blank">EUPL</a> licence. The source code can be downloaded from the Commission's Joinup pages: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/eusurvey/home" target="_blank">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/eusurvey/home</a></p>

message.about.paragraph.three=	<h2>Features</h2>\
								<p>EUSurvey has a wide variety of features, designed to meet varying survey needs.The full list of available features is given below:</p>\
								<h3 class="h3Privacy">Form Features</h3>\
								<h4>Customizable forms</h4>\
								<p>In the easy-to-use editor you can choose from a variety of question types - from simple text and multiple-choice questions to spreadsheet questions or multimedia survey elements. Structure your survey using special structural elements.</p>\
								<h4>Dependent questions</h4>\
								<p>EUSurvey can display additional questions and fields, depending on the answers given by the participant, making the survey interactive.</p>\
								<h4>Scheduled publishing</h4>\
								<p>Publish and unpublish your survey automatically at a specified point in time.</p>\
								<h4>Modify your form after publication</h4>\
								<p>You can modify a published survey without losing any contributions.</p>\
								<h4>Languages</h4>\
								<p>The user interface is available in 23 of the official EU languages, and you can translate your form into any of the 136 languages covered by ISO 639-1, from Abkhaz to Zulu.</p>\
								<h4>Security</h4>\
								<p>EUSurvey has the infrastructure needed to secure the online forms.</p>\
								<h4>Sending out invitations directly from the application</h4>\
								<p>Selected contacts can be managed in the 'Address Book' and used to send out individual e-mails to every single contact containing individual access links.</p>\
								<h4>Advanced privacy</h4>\
								<p>You can guarantee the participant's privacy by creating an anonymous form. Connection details will then not be available to you as the author of the form.</p>\
								<h4>Customise the look and feel</h4>\
								<p>With the built-in CSS style editor and embedded rich-text editors for all visible elements, you have full control over the form's layout. A large list of survey themes makes it easy to adapt the form to a project's identity. You can choose between single page and multi-page surveys.</p>\
								<h4>Save a contribution as draft</h4>\
								<p>You can allow participants to save their contribution as a draft on the server and continue later.</p>\
								<h4>Offline answering</h4>\
								<p>With EUSurvey, you can answer a form offline before submitting a contribution to the server at a later point in time.</p>\
								<h4>Automatic numbering</h4>\
								<p>To structure your survey, EUSurvey can number your form's elements for you.</p>\
								<h4>Enhanced contrast</h4>\
								<p>Visually impaired participants can choose a high-contrast version of the survey. This is created automatically for each form.</p>\
								<h4>Uploading supporting files</h4>\
								<p>You can add files to your survey by uploading them. These files can be downloaded by every participant in your survey.</p>\
								<h3 class="h3Privacy">Form Management</h3>\
								<h4>Publishing a survey</h4>\
								<p>You can choose to publish your survey automatically on the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/publicsurveys" target="_blank">list of public surveys</a> available via the European Commission's EUSurvey application, to give it even more exposure.</p>\
								<h4>Working together</h4>\
								<p>For surveys that are managed by multiple users, EUSurvey lets you define advanced permissions for other users to test a survey or to analyse the results.</p>\
								<h3 class="h3Privacy">Result Management</h3>\
								<h4>Analysing your results</h4>\
								<p>EUSurvey offers basic result analysis capabilities and visualization of data in histograms and chart views. You can also export survey results to standard spreadsheet formats in order to import them into statistical applications.</p>\
								<h4>Publishing your results </h4>\
								<p>Use the possibilities EUSurvey offers to publish a sub-set of all submitted answers on the internal pages of the application. Statistics and charts can be calculated and created automatically by the system.</p>\
								<h4>Editing submitted contributions </h4>\
								<p>Let your participants modify a contribution after it has been submitted, if they want to.</p>
