    <h4>Article 1 - Parties</h4>
        <p>This Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is established between the following parties:</p>
            <p>
                1. <b>the European Commission (EC)</b> and its Directorate General for Informatics (DIGIT)
                    (hereby “Service Provider“ or “Processor“) and
            </p>
            <p>
                2. <b>the natural person or a legal entity</b> creating a survey in EU Survey or on behalf of which a Survey is
                created (hereafter “Survey Owner“ or “User“ or “Controller“), whether the survey is made available

            </p>
        <p>Together and hereinafter each referred to solely as a 'Party' and together 'the Parties'.</p><br>
    <h4>Article 2 - Scope of this Agreement</h4>
        <p>
            2.1 This Agreement sets out the allocation of respective roles, responsibilities and practical arrangements
            between the controller and the processor, for compliance with their data protection obligations under
            Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679, respectively, when carrying out the processing
            operation of EU Survey, by creating, using, promoting, or otherwise making available to third parties a
            survey by using the EU Survey tool and includes a standard common set of instructions provided to the
            processor (Service Provider) by the controller (Survey Owner).
        </p>
        <p>
            2.2 The applicability of either Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 or Regulation (EU) 2016/679 will depend on which
            Regulation the Survey Owner is subject to. In case the Survey Owner is a Union institution, body,
            office or agency, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 will apply; otherwise, it will be Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
            In any case, the Service Provider is subject to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In case the Survey Owner is
            subject neither to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 or to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the Survey Owner hereby
            commits to be compliant with the laws or rules that are applicable in its jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.3 For the purpose of this Agreement, the definitions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725

        </p>
        <p>
            2.4 Description of the service: EU Survey is a free web application for online survey creation and
            publication that is developed, operated and maintained by DIGIT. Personal information needs to be
            processed by the Processor in order for the service to be provided to the Survey Owner. All data,
            personal and non-personal, that are collected via the EU Survey tool are hosted in the datacentres
            of the Service Provider (hereafter, 'Processing Operation').
        </p><br>
    <h4>Article 3 - Nature and Purpose of processing</h4>
        <p>
            3.1. For the following processing activities as described in this paragraph, the Survey Owner will act as a
            data controller once a survey is created and the Service Provider as a data processor. The main Processing
            Operation consists of the following processing activities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Service Provider, through EU Survey, collects and uses the personal information of the Survey Owner
                for the purpose of the user to connect to the EU Survey application and use the provided service for
                creating, managing, sharing and publishing online questionnaires and surveys. Full name (first and
                last name) and email address are retrieved by an automatic identity verification process via EU-Login
                and the European Commission's Central User Database, which is stored at the Data Centre of the European
                Commission. The contact details of the Survey Owner (first name and last name, email address) may also
                be used for contacting the user or provide support and for other quality management purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                EU Survey is using <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/privacy-policy/europa-analytics_en">
                Europa Analytics</a> for traffic statistics and analytics. Europa Analytics is the
                corporate service that monitors and evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the European
                Commission's websites on Europa. Europa Analytics is based on the open source analytics platform
                “Matomo“ and is installed on a webserver. Both the infrastructure and software are under the full
                control of the European Commission and comply with the current EU data protection legislation.
            </li>
            <li>
                All data related to EUSurvey, i.e. personal data that might be collected in a survey, are stored on
                the servers of the Service Provider. This information is under the responsibility and direct
                control of the Survey Owner (user).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            3.2. EU Survey specific content data that constitutes personal data, and may be collected in a survey
            falls out of the scope of this Agreement. This processing activity is under the exclusive
            responsibility of each Survey Owner when creating and sharing a survey with any third parties, acting
            as a data controller to ensure that personal data is collected in line with Regulation 2018/1725
            (EUDPR) or Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            3.3 EU Survey is protected by EU-Login that is covered by Record DPR-EC-03187 and falls out of the
            scope of this Agreement. DG DIGIT processes personal data of the Survey Owner (user) during the
            user-authentication process in order to securely verify the identity of the user and provide access
            to the application that the user intends to use. The data entered by the user is compared to the
            stored account information that the user holds when creating his/her EU-Login profile, thus
            successfully authenticating the user. For EU-Login, DIGIT, Unit D3, is the sole controller.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.4 Detailed information about the processing operations and its processing activities described in
            paragraph 3.1. is provided in Annex I to this Agreement that constitutes the Record of processing
            activities that needs to be maintained by the data processor in line with Article 31(2) of Regulation
            2018/1725 and Article 30 (2) of Regulation 2016/679 respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.5. By creating an account in EU Survey and prior to creating a survey as a survey owner, the user
            has to provide a minimum set of personal data in order to use the tool. At this stage and before
            creating a survey, the European Commission is considered to be the sole controller (DPR-EC-01488).
            Once a survey is created paragraphs 3.1. to 3.4 are applicable.
        </p><br>
    <h4>Article 4 - Processing of personal data by the service provider as data processor</h4>
        <p>
            4.1. The European Commission as the service provider, collects and uses the Survey Owner's personal
            data through EU Survey for the purpose of enabling the survey Owner to connect to the EU Survey
            application and use the service for creating and publishing online questionnaires.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.2 The European Commission however, is not responsible for the privacy and data protection policies or
            practices undertaken by the Survey Owner using the EU Survey application to create, communicate and
            publish an EU survey to a wider audience (other survey users). All personal data collected within such
            a survey will be processed by and under the responsibility of the Survey Owner including in particular
            a lawful collection of personal data in line with Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and/or
            Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.3 It is strongly recommended to the Survey Owner to create, adopt and communicate a separate privacy
            statement (notice) and a record of processing operations when processing personal data using this tool
            to all survey contributors.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.4. The service provider shall process on behalf of the EU Survey owner (user) any personal data
            included in or relating to this DPA in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and solely for the
            purposes set out herein. The subject matter, duration, nature and purpose of the processing, types of
            personal data and categories of data subjects concerning the processing by the service provider on
            the user's behalf are as follows:

                        depends on the service class. EU Survey benefit from a 'Gold' service class that implies daily,
                        weekly and monthly backups that are kept respectively for 35 days, 35 days and 1 year. Residual
                        copies of deleted data may also continue to exist in our backups for disaster recovery purposes
                        up to 1 year after the deletion has occurred, at which point it will be overwritten.<br>

    <h4>Article 8 - Data Subjects' Requests</h4>
        <p>
            A data subject whose personal data is processed by the data controller in relation to the creation of
            Surveys by the Survey Owner (user) has specific rights under Chapter III (Articles 14-25) of Regulation
            (EU) No 2018/1725 or Chapter III (Articles 13-23) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular the right to
            access, rectify or erase their personal data and the right to restrict or, where applicable, the right to
            object to processing or the right to data portability. Should data subjects have any queries concerning
            the processing of their personal data, they shall address themselves to the data controller. They may
            also address themselves to the Data Protection Officer of the data controller, in case there is one.
            They have the right to lodge a complaint at any time to the European Data Protection Supervisor.<br>
            The processor shall assist the survey owner (user) for the fulfilment of the Survey Owner's obligation to
            respond to requests for exercising rights of data subjects in relation to the Agreement. The processor
            shall inform the Survey Owner without undue delay about such requests addressed to it.<br>
            The duration of processing of personal data by the service provider per type of processing activity will
            not exceed the period referred to in the beginning of this Agreement. Upon expiry of this period, the
            service provider shall, upon request and at the choice of the survey owner, fully or partially delete
            all personal data (including all copies) processed on behalf of the Survey owner, without any undue delay
            unless Union law requires a longer storage of those personal data. All data included in each Survey or
            Questionnaire can be permanently deleted by the Survey Owner itself. In addition to this each Survey
            Owner can permanently delete the account it holds on EU Survey by clicking on the “delete the account“
            button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the deletion of back-up data is subject to the EC's specific retention policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The service provider shall keep the personal data in a form that permits identification of data subjects
            for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subcontracting of the service or performance of the contract by third parties requires prior written
            authorisation from the client. If part or all of the processing of personal data is subcontracted to a
            third party, the service provider shall pass on its obligations referred to in the Appendix in writing
            to those parties, including subcontractors. At the request of the client, the service provider shall
            provide a document providing evidence of this commitment.
