		<ol class="numbered" type="1">
			<li><b>Your EUSurvey account and surveys.</b> If you create an
				account on the application, you are responsible for maintaining the
				security of your account and surveys, and you are fully responsible
				for all activities that occur under the account and any other
				actions taken in connection with your account. You must not describe
				or assign keywords to your surveys in a misleading or unlawful
				manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or
				reputation of others. DIGIT may change or remove any description or
				keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise
				likely to cause DIGIT, and by extension all the European Union
				institutions, liability. You must immediately notify DIGIT of any
				unauthorized use of your account, of a survey of yours, or any other
				breaches of security. DIGIT will not be liable for any acts or
				omissions made by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as
				a result of such acts or omissions.<br/>
				You are obliged to use the EUSurvey system sparingly and responsibly.
				In particular, you are obliged to delete your survey once the collection
				and analysis of contributions has been completed. You also accept our
				automatic deletion process for surveys that have been inactive for more
				than one year (an inactive survey is one that no longer receives
				contributions and is no longer updated). In addition, we reserve the
				right to delete any survey at any time at our sole discretion.</li>
			<li><b>Responsibility of Authors.</b> If you create a survey,
				upload material to one or link to material from your survey, or
				otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available
				by means of the application (any such material, "<b>Content</b>"),
				You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm
				resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether
				the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file,
				or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and
				warrant that:
				<ul>
					<li>The downloading, copying and use of the Content will not
						infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the
						copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third
						party;</li>
					<li>If your employer has rights to intellectual property you
						create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer
						to post or make available the Content, including but not limited
						to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to
						all rights in or to the Content;</li>
					<li>You have fully complied with any third-party licenses
						relating to the Content and have done all things necessary to
						successfully pass through to end users any required terms;</li>
					<li>The Content does not contain or install any viruses,
						worms, malware, trojan horses or other harmful or destructive
						content;</li>
					<li>The Content is not used for political activism or
						propaganda.</li>
					<li>The Content is not spam, is not machine or
						randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted
						commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites
						or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to
						further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as
						to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>
					<li>The Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats
						or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity
						rights of any third party;</li>
					<li>Your survey is not getting advertised via unwanted
						electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists,
						other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional
						methods;</li>
					<li>Your survey is not named in a manner that misleads your
						readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For
						example, your survey's alias or name is not the name of a person
						other than yourself or company other than your own;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>By submitting Content to EUSurvey for inclusion in your
					survey, you grant DIGIT a world-wide, royalty-free, and
					non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the
					Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and
					promoting your survey. If you delete Content, DIGIT will use
					reasonable efforts to remove it from the application, but you
					acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be
					made immediately removed.</p>
				<p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties,
					DIGIT has the right (though not the obligation) to, in DIGIT's sole
					discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in DIGIT's
					opinion, violates any official policy or is in any way harmful or
					objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the
					application to any individual or entity for any reason.</p></li>
			<li><p>
					<b>Responsibility of participants.</b> DIGIT has not reviewed, and
					cannot review, all of the material posted to the different surveys,
					and cannot, therefore, be responsible for that material's content,
					use or effects. By operating the application, DIGIT does not
					represent or imply that it endorses the material there created, or
					that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or
					non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as
					necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from
					viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
					content.
				</p>
				<p>DIGIT disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting
					from the use by users of the service or from any downloading by
					those persons of content there available.</p></li>
			<li><b>Content Posted on Other Websites.</b> DIGIT cannot review
				all of the material, including computer software, made available
				through user-generated surveys and webpages to which EUSurvey links,
				and that link to EUSurvey. DIGIT does not have any control over
				those non-EUSurvey websites and webpages and is not responsible for
				their contents or their use. By linking to a non-EUSurvey website or
				webpage, DIGIT does not represent or imply that it endorses such
				website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as
				necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from
				viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
				content. DIGIT disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting
				from your use of non-EUSurvey websites and webpages.</li>
			<li><b>Copyright Infringement.</b> As DIGIT asks others to
				respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the
				intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material
				located on or linked to by a survey violates your copyright, you are
				encouraged to notify DIGIT. DIGIT will respond to all such notices,
				including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing
				material or disabling all links to the infringing material. DIGIT
				will terminate a user's access to and use of the application if,
				under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a
				repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property
				rights of DIGIT or others.</li>

				agreement.</li>
			<li><b>Termination.</b> DIGIT may terminate your access to all

				time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective
				immediately. If you wish to terminate this agreement or your
				EUSurvey account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using
				the Website. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature
				survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
				provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
				liability.</li>
			<li><b>Disclaimer of Warranties.</b> The EUSurvey application is
				provided "as is". DIGIT and its suppliers and licensors hereby
				disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including,
				without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
				particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither DIGIT nor its
				suppliers and licensors make any warranty that the application will
				be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or
				uninterrupted.</li>
			<li><b>Limitation of Liability.</b> In no event will DIGIT, or
				its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject
				matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, strict
				liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special,
				incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement
				for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use
				or loss or corruption of data. DIGIT shall have no liability for any
				failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The
				foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable
				law.</li>

				acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the
				transmission of technical data exported from the European Union or
				the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Service
				will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights
				of any third party.</li>
			<li><b>Indemnification.</b> You agree to indemnify and hold
				harmless DIGIT, its contractors, and its licensors, and their
				respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and

			<li><b>Miscellaneous.</b> This Agreement constitutes the entire
				agreement between DIGIT and you, the user, concerning the subject
				matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment
				signed by an authorized executive of DIGIT, or by the posting by
				DIGIT of a revised version. If any part of this agreement is held
				invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the
				party's original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in
				full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or
				condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one
				instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent
				breach thereof.</li>
