These FontFiles have been generated by merging different FreeFont files together.
This bakes in Fallback Fonts and was necessary due to our PDF rendering process
and due to not all FreeFonts containing the full character set.
FreeSerif had lots of characters, e.g. FreeSans does not have.

An example Fallback Chain would now be: FreeSansBoldOblique -> FreeSansBold -> FreeSans -> FreeSerif
