    longDescription: |
      EUSurvey is the official online survey management tool of the European
      Commission. Its development was started in 2013 under the supervision of
      [DIGIT](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/informatics/index\_en.htm) and is
      published as open source software under the terms of the EUPL public
      license on JOINUP at [this
      link](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/eusurvey/home). 


      EUSurvey is a servlet based application and can be installed on any system
      that runs a JAVA servlet-container. The systemâ€™s development and reference
      installation runs Apache Tomcat as the servlet container and uses a MySQL
      database to store its information. The build process is assisted by Maven
      for resolving external dependencies. This document describes the steps
      that are necessary to compile and install the open source version of
      EUSurvey. 


      Please notice that EUSurvey can be configured to run on a large number of
      different environments.
